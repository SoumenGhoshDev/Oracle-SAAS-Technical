### For a parameterized OTBI report which is best approach and why?

The best approach is to use **Prompt** instead of **Filter** on existing columns. The main difference is when you run the report or click on `Open` Button for a particular OTBI report, in case of Filter it will first appear with running report with default parameter. But if we use prompt it will not run untill you enter some value in prompt. In this way you can save the time to run the report for first time unnecessarily if you use prompt.
